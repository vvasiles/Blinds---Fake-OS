Description:

# MISTERY CRIME SCENE # 

  The program consists of a multiple-level game that requires the perspicacity of the player to locate and collect various
required items as clues from a crowded crime scene that lead to the murderer and the "weapon" used. Each level - crime scene
represents a photo of a room full of hidden/ shaded objects. The player searches the image and tries to find the objects 
comprised in a checklist for each level. The game will contain more than one storyline with multiple difficulty options, based on
a time limit for each level and how easy is the element to retrieve. A hint option will also be implemented.

  Depending on the selected difficulty level, an online leaderboard will be implemented through the CMU server, port 15112, viewing
the best total times achieved per each level and also per crime solved. To be qualified for the leaderboard, the number of hints will
limited.

Checkpoint 1:

  Everything I mentioned in the first paragraph, besides the Hint feature. 

Libraries:

-> TKinter for the GUI of the game
-> Sockets for the connection to server, generating the leaderboard

I hope you will enjoy my program! Thank you!
