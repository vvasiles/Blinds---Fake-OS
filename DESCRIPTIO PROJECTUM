Description:

# Blinds - Fake OS aka OS Simulator aka OS Emulator aka RIP Steve Jobs # 

For my final project in 15-112, I will be elaborating an Operating System Simulator, with features like:

-Text Editor
-Calculator
-Paint-like app
-An old-school game, such as Pong

The main interface will handle files like text / canvas in the UI, that can be opened from and saved in there. 

In the task bar, there will be an active clock, the minimized instances of the current processes and a button for the start window.

The start windowe contains the 4 widgets for the apps, a shut down button which exits the entire window, and a log off button!

All the apps will have implemented a special frame that permits drag and drop only within the main window boundaries, which also handles
an exit button and a minimize button, making the process appear in the taskbar.

The text editor will create, save, and open files along with copy/cut/paste options. More features like font, size to be added in Checkpoint 2

The canvas app will create, save and open files, handle a few colors, different thicknesses of brushes, eraser, a few shapes. 

The game will handle simple but precise physics.
  
Checkpoint 1:

  Main UI, Start Menu, Calculator, Notepad.
 
Checkpoint 2;

  Canvas, Pong, importing files in the main UI, minimizing, implemenmting the special frame
  Friendlier, better integrated UI

Libraries:

-> TKinter for the GUI of the game
-> datetime and threading  for the clock in the taskbar
-> os for handling files
-> tkFont - for fonts and styling 
-> tkMessageBox for different notices and confirmations

I hope you will enjoy my program! Thank you!
